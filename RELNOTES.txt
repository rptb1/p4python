                            Release Notes for
               P4Python, Perforce's script API for Python

                             Version 2013.1

Introduction

	This document lists all user-visible changes to P4Python starting
	from release 2007.3, the first supported P4Python release.

	Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCC, for example, 2007.3/30547.
	YYYY is the year; R is the release of that year; CCCCC is the
	bug fix change level. Each bug fix in these release notes is
	marked by its change number. Any build includes all bug fixes
	of all previous releases and all bug fixes of the current
	release up to the bug fix change level.

	To display the version of P4Python you have installed, 
	start Python and issue the following commands: 

		>>> import P4
		>>> print(P4.P4.identify())

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing P4Python

	Windows users can download an installer containing pre-built
	packages for P4Python from the Perforce FTP site at
	ftp://ftp.perforce.com/perforce. Users on other platforms must
	build from source, as detailed below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading P4Python

	Before installing P4Python 2012.3, uninstall any older versions of
	P4Python. Some earlier versions of P4Python consisted of the
	following files, which must be deleted before installing a later
	version:

		p4.py
		p4.pyc
		p4.pyo
		P4Client.pyd

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building P4Python from Source

	1. Download the Perforce C++ API from the Perforce FTP site at
	   "ftp://ftp.perforce.com/perforce". The API archive is located
	   in release and platform-specific subdirectories and is named
	   "p4api.tgz" for non-Windows platforms and "p4api_vs2008_static.zip"
	   for Windows. Mac OS X users should get the API from either the
	   "bin.darwin90x86" or "bin.darwin90x86_64" platform directory.

	   Note: 32-bit builds of P4Python require a 32-bit version of the
	         C++ API and a 32-bit version of Python. 64-bit builds of
	         P4Python require a 64-bit version of the C++ API and a 
	         64-bit version of Python.

	   Unzip the archive into an empty directory.

	2. Extract the P4Python API archive into a new, empty directory.

	3. To build P4Python, run the following command:

	   python setup.py build --apidir <Perforce C++ API absolute path>

	   Note: in order to reinstall cleanly P4Python, remove the
	         directory named "build".

	4. To test your P4Python build, run the following command:

	   python p4test.py

	   Note: the test harness requires the Perforce server executable
	         p4d to be installed and in the PATH.

	5. To install P4Python, run the following command:

	   python setup.py install --apidir <Perforce C++ API absolute path>

	   Note: on Unix/Mac platforms, the installation must be performed
	         as the root user. Also ensure that the umask is set
	         correctly (typically 0022) before running the install.
	         With a umask of 027, for example, the resulting installed
	         files are accessible only by users of group root.

	SSL support
	-----------
	
	Perforce Server 2012.1 and later supports SSL connections and the
	C++ API has been compiled with this support. For applications that
	do not require SSL support the C++ API provides a stub library
	(libp4sslstub.*) to satisfy the linker requirements.
	
	P4Python will build with the stub library by default. To enable
	SSL support, provide the switch --ssl [librarypath] to the build.
	Without [librarypath] the linker will use the default ssl libraries 
	provided by the operating system. If a library path is provided,
	the linker will be instructed to look there first.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility Statements

	Server Compatibility

	  You can use any release of P4Python with any release of the
	  Perforce server later than 2001.1

	API Compatibility

	  The 2013.1 release of P4Python requires either the 2012.2 or
	  2013.1 Perforce API. Older releases will not compile and are not 
	  supported. 

	Python Compatibility

	  The 2013.1 release of P4Python is supported building from
	  source with Python 2.7, 3.3. Python 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 are not
	  supported.
  
	  For detailed compatibility, please check the following table:
   
		Python Release | P4Python Release
		======================================
		2.3 or earlier | not supported
		2.4            | 2008.2 (unsupported)
		2.5            | 2007.3 up to 2009.2 (unsupported)
		2.6            | 2009.1 up to 2012.2
		2.7            | 2010.1 or later
		3.0            | 2010.1 up to 2012.3 (unsupported)
		3.1            | 2010.2 up to 2012.3 (unsupported)
		3.2            | 2011.1 up to 2012.3
		3.3            | 2012.3 or later

	  The P4Python 32-bit Windows installer requires Python 3.3 32-bit.
	  The P4Python 64-bit Windows installer requires Python 3.3 64-bit.
	  
	  The P4Python installer on Windows requires that the location of the
	  Python interpreter can be found in the PATH environment variable.
    
	OpenSSL Compatibility

	  To build P4Python with encrypted communication support, you must
	  use the version of OpenSSL that Perforce C/C++ API has been
	  built against.  Running P4Python linked to an older library will 
	  fail with the error:
	
	    "SSL library must be at least version 1.0.1."

	  The 2013.1 release of P4Python is supported with OpenSSL 1.0.1.

	  For detailed compatibility, please check the following table:

		Perforce C/C++ API Version | OpenSSL Release
		============================================
		     2012.1                | 	1.0.0
		     2012.2+               | 	1.0.1

	Platform Compatibility

	  This release is certified on the following platforms:

		Linux 2.6 Intel (x86, x86_64)
		Solaris 10 Intel (x86)
		Windows 8, Vista, 7, 2008 Intel (x86, x86_64)
		FreeBSD 6.0, 7.0 Intel (x86, x86_64)
		Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 (x86_64)

	  Note: As of 2012.1, a universal build of the Perforce C/C++ 
		API is no longer available for Darwin or Mac OS X.  
		P4Python is now a 64-bit only library on Darwin. This 
		has been tested with a universal build of Python and 
		is known to work.
         
	Compiler Compatibility

	  To build P4Python from source, you must use a version of
	  P4Python that has been compiled with the same compiler used to
	  build the Perforce C++ API. For most platforms, use gcc/g++.

	  Attempting to use a different compiler or a different version
	  of the compiler causes linker errors due to differences in
	  name handling.

	  On Windows platforms, the P4Python installer was built with 
	  python.org and Visual Studio 2010.

          For Python 2.7 support on Windows, Visual Studio 2008 is
	  required.

	Compatibility with Previous Releases of P4Python

	  P4Python 2013.1 is compatible with previous releases of
	  P4Python from Perforce Software, unless otherwise specified.

	Known Limitations

	  The Perforce client-server protocol is not designed to support
	  multiple concurrent queries over the same connection. For this
	  reason, multi-threaded applications using the C++ API or the
	  script APIs (P4Perl, P4Ruby, etc.) should ensure that a
	  separate connection is used for each thread or that only one
	  thread may use a shared connection at a time.

	Compatibility with the P4Python from the Public Depot 

	  Perforce P4Python is significantly different from the version
	  of P4Python in the Perforce Public Depot. Perforce P4Python 
	  contains several improvements and interface changes 
	  intended to make P4Python consistent with the other scripting 
	  interfaces and with Python in general.

	  If you are migrating from Public Depot version of P4Python,
	  edit your scripts to ensure that the scripts comply with the
	  new interface. The differences are detailed below.

	New module name
	---------------
	The P4Python module has been renamed from p4 to P4. For example:

	Old:
	>>> import p4
	>>> p4c = p4.P4()

	New:
	>>> import P4
	>>> p4 = P4.P4()

	By convention, Public Depot P4Python used "p4c" as an instance
	variable because "p4" was used as a module name. Because the
	module has been renamed "P4", you can use "p4" for your instance
	variables. All demos and tests use the new convention.

	Deleted methods
	---------------

	The following methods have been deleted from the P4 class and
	are no longer available.

	dropped			Use connected()

	parse_forms		Form parsing is now always on

	tagged			See tagged attribute below

	New methods
	-----------

	The following methods are new to Perforce P4Python.

	connected		Returns True if the client is connected

	format_xxx		Converts a dict-based specification into 
				a string (replace xxx with spec type, for 
				example: format_client)

	identify		Returns information about P4Python

	parse_xxx		Converts a string into a P4.Spec object 
				(replace xxx with spec type)

	run_filelog		Runs 'p4 filelog' and returns an array of
				P4.DepotFile objects

	run_login		Runs "p4 login" using current password

	run_password		Runs "p4 passwd" with old and new password 

	run_submit		Runs "p4 submit"

	Attributes
	----------

	Perforce P4Python provides the following attributes. Attributes
	can be set in the P4() constructor or by using their setters and
	getters. For example:
	
	>>> import P4
	>>> p4 = P4.P4(client="myclient", port="1666")
	>>> p4.user = 'me'

	Most attributes can be set and read. Attributes are strings unless
	noted otherwise.
	
	api_level		API compatibility level, INTEGER

	charset			The character set to use. String, 
				not a constant as in previous versions

	client			Client to use (P4CLIENT)

	cwd			Current Working Directory

	debug			Debug level (for debugging P4Python), INTEGER

	errors			Array of errors returned by the server 
				(Read-Only), LIST

	exception_level		Determines whether exceptions are thrown, 
				INTEGER

	host			Client Host

	input			Input for next command, can be STRING, LIST 
				or DICTIONARY

	maxlocktime		MaxLockTime for commands, INTEGER

	maxresults		MaxResults for commands, INTEGER

	maxscanrows		MaxScanRows for commands, INTEGER

	p4config_file		Returns the config file path (Read-Only) 

	password		Value of P4PASSWD

	port			Value of P4PORT

	prog			Name of the script, shown in the server log

	server_level		Returns the server level (Read-Only)

	tagged			Boolean value, determines whether to use
				tagged mode, INTEGER

	ticket_file		Returns the name of the ticket file

	user			Value of P4USER

	warnings		Array of warnings returned by the server 
				(Read-Only), LIST
	
	Tagged mode and form parsing
	----------------------------

	In Perforce P4Python 2007.3 and later, form parsing and tagged 
	output are enabled by default. (In Public Depot P4Python, 
	tagged output and form parsing mode were disabled by default, 
	but most scripts enabled them immediately.)

	Form parsing cannot be disabled explicitly, but tagged output can
	be enabled or disabled by setting p4.tagged as follows:

		p4.tagged = False	# Disabled
		p4.tagged = True	# Enabled

	This method can be used to disable form parsing, because 
	form parsing does not work when tagged output is 
	disabled.

Key to symbols used in change notes below.

	  * -- requires new p4Python
	 ** -- requires new p4d server program
	*** -- requires new P4API

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs fixed in 2013.1

	#628525 *
		When using Python 3.X P4Python created a memory leak for
		every call. This has now been fixed. Note that the 
		fix requires upgrading to Python 3.3. All previous version of
		Python 3.X are not supported and P4Python 2013.1 will not
		compile with these releases.
		
	#634817 *
	    Reformatted P4.py to use spaces instead of tabs, following
	    the Python coding standard.
		
New functionality in 2012.3

	#533539 *
		P4Python is now compatible with Python 3.3 and will complete
		all test cases.
	
	#564572 (Bug #59272) *
		Comments in forms are now preserved in the spec object when using
		P4.parse_spec. The comment can be accessed and changed through the
		P4.Spec.comment attribute. Comments are used by the P4.format_spec
		methods such as P4.format_client(). This is useful for form-out triggers.
	
	#568867 *
		When decoding strings in Python 3 from a non-Unicode Perforce server, 
		P4Python normally assumes that all strings are encoded in UTF8. P4.encoding 
		can be set to a legal Python encoding to change the decoding of any content 
		from the Perforce Server. If P4.encoding is set, any decoding error will 
		cause an exception to be thrown. 
		The special encoding 'raw' can be used to receive Python bytes 
		instead of Unicode strings. 
		P4.encoding is only available when compiled with Python 3.
	
Bugs fixed in 2012.3

	#564572 (Bug #32834) *
		In Python 3 it was impossible to reset the charset to None or ''.
		This is now fixed.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2012.2

	#524819 (Bug #59800) *
		P4Python now supports Apple Mountain Lion (10.8).
	
	#503392 (Bug #56081) *
	    P4.run_print() would return None for a non-existing file.
	    Now it returns [] for consistency.
	
	#503375 (Bug #56479) *
	    Added P4.run_tickets() method to list local tickets.
	    Note that P4.run('tickets') still gives the old error 
	    message "Must upgrade to 2004.2 p4 to access tickets."
		
	#498110 (Bug #56512) * ** ***
	    Support for the new progress indicator API. P4Python
	    supplies a new progress attribute, which can take an
	    instance of P4.Progress class or subclass. Progress
	    information is currently only supported for submits and
	    sync -q. Details can be found in the documentation.
	
	#491236 (Bug #57828) *
	    New convenience method P4.iterate_<specs>() that allows
	    easy iteration through some or all spec objects such as 
	    clients or changes. Details can be found in the documentation.

Bugs fixed in 2012.2

	#513715 (Bug #59191) *
	    Fixed a bug where P4Python would leak memory when calling
	    an OutputHandler, and would leak more memory if the
	    OutputHandler returned HANDLED.

 	#512425 (Bug #58722) *
 	    P4#parse_client could raise the exception "Unknown field name 
 	    'StreamAtChange'." when parsing a stream client workspace.
	    Internal spec definition has been updated to resolve this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
New functionality in 2012.1

	#403096 (Bug #51898) * ** ***
	    Enable "action resolve" to support resolves of branches, 
	    deletes and file types. The existing P4.Resolver class
	    has been extended with a new method actionResolve() that
	    will be invoked if an "action resolve" is required.
	    Details can be found in the documentation.
	
	#411866 (Bug #51896) * ** ***
	    P4Python supports SSL connections if compiled with SSL
	    support. Instructions on how to compile with SSL support can
	    be found at the top of this document under "Building P4Python
	    from Source" and in the documentation.
		
	    P4.identify() will then report the version of the OpenSSL 
	    library used for building the Perforce C++ API (not the
	    version P4Python is linked against).

Bugs fixed in 2012.1:

	#510916 (Bug #59060) *
	    Fixed a bug where P4Python would increment the reference
	    count of an OutputHandler each time run was called.

	#446148 (Bug #55062) *
	    Fixed a test hardness due an incompatibility with Python 2.6

	#397007 (Bug #49820) *
	    A fatal server error would leave P4Python in an undefined
	    state which would result in incorrect output for
	    successive commands. P4Python will now disconnect and
	    clean up when encountering a fatal error.
		
	#420204 (Bug #52909) *
	    Python would crash with a segmentation fault if a custom
	    Resolver object was used to resolve binary files. Fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2011.1

	#328169 (Bug #45862) * **
	    Enable streams in P4Python by default. With this change,
	    streams specific specs such as streams depots are listed.
	    Disable the listing of streams specific specs by either
	    setting the api_level to a value below 70 or by disabling
	    stream handling explicitly through the P4.streams attribute:
            
	      p4.streams = False

	#318056 *
	    All run methods now support keyword arguments in order
	    to disable 'tagged' mode or to provide an OutputHandler
	    for a single command only without having to wrap the command
	    in a 'with' block:
	
		p4.run_counter('mycounter', tagged = False)
		p4.run_files('//...', handler = MyOutputHandler() )
		
	    More than one keyword argument can be provided if required.
	    All attributes that can be changed for an active connection
	    can be provided as keyword arguments.

	#317619 (Bug #42251) *
	    P4Python supports a callback interface by providing a
	    P4.handler attribute. Set P4.handler to an instance of a
	    subclass of P4.OutputHandler to enable callbacks.
	    When a handler is defined, P4Python will invoke the handler
	    for every response it receives from the Perforce Server
	    immediately instead of collecting all results together in
	    an array first. This can be used to make applications more
	    scalable and more responsive if large results are expected.
	    See the documentation for details on the OutputHandler class.
    
	#331330 (Bug #43211) *
	    P4Python now allows setting P4 registry values on Windows and 
	    Mac OS. P4.set_env(name, value) sets an entry and P4.set_env(name)
	    deletes the entry. This is equivalent to running 
	    'p4 set name=value' from the command line.
    
Bugs fixed in 2011.1

	#385159 (Bug #49324) ***
	    On Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 2008, a client running as
	    Administrator would fail to properly process file names in
	    non-ASCII character sets (such as Shift-JIS).

	#328989 (Bug #44038) *
	    Prevent users from assigning non-string values to spec
	    objects such as labels or client workspaces. Assigning 
	    values other than strings could crash P4Python.
			
	#328975 (Bug #45395) *
	    Updated the stored spec templates for user, client and change
	    and added streams. These are required, for example,
	    for form-triggers that do not connect to the server first.
			
	#328952 (Bug #45956) *
	    Under some circumstances P4Python would try to raise
	    a P4Error, which has been renamed to P4Exception.
	    This is now fixed.

	#328223 (Bug #44820) *
	    P4.identify() reports the platform on Mac OS as DARWIN in line
	    with all other Perforce products.

	#328187 (Bug #44819) *
	    P4.identify() now reports P4Python as P4PYTHON in line with
	    all other Perforce products.

	#326428 (Bug #46255) *
	    P4.Map.reverse would return a P4API.P4Map object. It now
	    returns an instance of P4.Map instead.
						
	#323887 (Bug #46151) *
	    P4.run_filelog() would throw an exception for rare
	    circumstances where no digest is defined for for a deleted
	    revision that was later readed. This is now fixed.
			
	#312206 (Bug #44742) *
	    Info messages were not shown when an exception was thrown.
	    This is because all messages of type info get silently
	    swallowed. They will still not show in the output with this
	    change, but they will be logged in the P4.message list.
	    Info messages like this will be forwarded to the OutputHandler
	    if present.
			
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
New functionality in 2010.2

	#257896 (Bug #38952) *
            P4Python now comes in a Perforce standardized directory 
            structure: p4python-<year>.<release>.<patchlevel>[-BETA].
            Source and binary distributions created via 'python setup.py'
            will follow this naming scheme.
		
	#257263 (Bug #37856) *
            Python 3.1 is now fully supported. It also has full support
            for Unicode-enabled Perforce Servers. This also means that
            P4.charset can be set to multibyte charsets such as UTF16.
		
	#257099 (Bug #38766) * ***
            Errors and warnings are now instances of P4Message.
            This object has the additional methods generic(), 
            severity() and (unique) msgid(), which makes parsing 
            of error messages easier.
            P4.warnings and P4.errors still return the errors and 
    	    warnings as strings for backwards compatibility.

	#239278 (Bug #38210) *
	    Added new SetTrack() and GetTrack() methods.
            For more details about server performance tracking see:
            http://kb.perforce.com/article/883

Bugs fixed in 2010.2

	#285704 (Bug #43213) *
            The connect() context would silently swallow exceptions
            thrown within the block. This means problems within the 
            following code would get missed unless explicitly caught
            within the block:
            
            with p4.connect():
            	# do something with p4
            # automatically disconnected	

            This is now fixed.
            
    	#287034 (Bug #43415) *
    	    Running 'print' on a file that started with '---' would
    	    crash Python. This is now fixed.
    	    There is still an oddity when p4.track = 1 and a user runs
    	    p4.run_print() on a file that only has lines starting with
    	    '--- '. In that case, the output of the print is lost. 
    	    Disable tracking by setting p4.track = 0 (the default) will
    	    solve this problem.

New functionality in 2010.1

	#235589 (Bug #35946) *
	    Compatibility with Python 3. This change makes P4Python 
	    incompatible with Python 2.5 and prior, but retains
	    compatibility with Python 2.6 (Python 2.7 also works
	    but is unsupported). 
	    Python 3.1 is currently only experimental because of
	    Unicode and 8-bit ASCII support. P4Python 2010.1 with
	    Python 3.1 at the moment only supports 7-bit ASCII 
	    on non-Unicode servers and UTF8 on Unicode servers.

	#231765 *
	    Added new P4.server_unicode attribute that allows script
	    writers to test whether or not a Perforce Server is in
	    internationalized (unicode) mode. 

	    P4.server_case_insensitive() has been changed from a method
	    to an attribute (that is, no brackets)

	    P4.server_level, P4.server_unicode and 
		P4.server_case_insensitive all will send a "info" command to 
		the server upon invocation if no previous command was sent 
		before. Previously, these commands would throw an exception 
		instead.

	#230480 *
	    New read-only string attributes PATCHLEVEL and OS
	    so that script writers can test the installation of P4Python
	    without having to parse the output of P4.identify()
	
Bugs fixed in 2010.1

	#242158 (Bug #38677) *
	    P4.identify() now correctly report 'NTX64' for 64-bit
	    builds on Windows.

	#230649 (Bug #37434) *
	    All keyword arguments passed in the constructor are now
	    evaluated correctly. 

	#235706 *
	    Support for P4.run_print() for more than one file.
	    Previously, P4.run_print() would throw an exception
	    when trying to print more than one file.

	#235718 (Bug #37841) *
	    P4.RAISE_ERROR has been renamed to P4.RAISE_ERRORS
	    for consistency with P4Ruby. P4.RAISE_ERROR is still
	    available for backwards compatibility.		

	#235730 (Bug #37186) *
	    Under rare circumstances P4.run_filelog() would throw an
	    "Index out of range" error for "fileSize" fields. This is 
	    now prevented.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2009.2

	#214490 (Bug #35417 ) *
	    New P4.server_case_sensitive() method enables scripts to
	    detect whether the server is case-sensitive. Can be called
	    only after a command has been issued to the server.

	#214611 (Bug #032917) *
	    Throw a P4Exception if user attempts to change the port after 
	    a connection is established. 

	#215413 (Bug #31789) *
	    Throw an exception if a user tries to set a charset wider
	    than one byte. Previously, all commands subsequent to
	    setting a multi-byte charset returned empty strings.

Bugs fixed in 2009.2

	#227423 (Bug #37143) *
	    The build script removed the release notes when invoked. Fixed.

	#214614 (Bug #34866) *
	    The P4.connected() method now correctly resets the flag when
	    detecting a dropped connection.

	#215406 *
	    P4.__enter__() now correctly returns self, which permits the
	    following idiom to work correctly:
	    
	    with p4.connect() as p:
		# use p here as an alias

	#209643 (Bug #36223) *
	    P4Python now builds with the latest API on Windows using
	    Visual Studio 2008.
	    Previously, the build failed because of a link error.

	#222723 (Bug #36558) *
	    The Map class removed '-' and '+' from the path if the
	    form Map.insert(lhs, rhs) was used, even if these characters
	    did not appear at the beginning of the path.
	    Now dashes and pluses are preserved within the path.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2009.1

	#191476 (Bug #26731) *
	    Support for the Python "with" statement.

	    P4.connect() now returns a Contect Management object that can
	    be used in a "with" statement with a block. When the block is
	    finished, the connection is automatically disconnected:

	    import P4
	    p4 = P4.P4()
	    with p4.connect():
	        # execute statements here
	        # p4 is now disconnected

	    Also, there are two new methods, P4.while_tagged() and 
	    P4.at_exception_level() that, when used in a "with" statement,
	    set the tagged mode and exception_level for the block and then 
	    reset it back to the original state. For example:

	    with p4.at_exception_level(P4.RAISE_ERROR): # no exceptions
	                                                # for warnings
	      p4.run_sync("//depot/main/...")

Bugs fixed in 2009.1

	#192108 (Bug #32920) *
	    P4Python now correctly parsse jobs when the jobspec contains
	    fields with names ending in numbers.

	#191458 (Bug #32834) *
	   Charset can now be reset to the empty string ''.

New functionality in 2008.2

	#164805 (Bug #30704) *
	    P4Python now builds under CYGWIN.

	#163103 (Bug #30363) *
	#166832 *
	    A new class P4.Map has been defined in P4Python
	    that allows users to create, and work with, Perforce mappings 
	    without requiring a connection to a server. Methods in the 
		P4.Map class are:

	    P4.Map()           Constructor.
 
	    P4.Map.join()      Class method. Joins two maps to create a 
	                       third.
	    
	    P4.Map.clear()     Empties the map

	    P4.Map.count()     Returns the number of entries in the map

	    P4.Map.is_empty()  Returns True if the map is empty

	    P4.Map.insert()    Adds new entries to the map

	    P4.Map.translate()  Translates a string through the map

	    P4.Map.includes()  Returns True if the supplied string is 
	                       visible through the map

	    P4.Map.reverse()   Swap left and right sides of the mapping

	    P4.Map.lhs()       Returns the left-hand-side of the map

	    P4.Map.rhs()       Returns the right-hand-side of the map

	    P4.Map.as_array()  Returns the map as an array

Bugs fixed in 2008.2

	#176515 (Bug #31367) *
	    Using P4.run_print() in untagged mode throws an exception:
	      IndexError: list index out of range
	    This is now fixed. P4.run_print() can be used both in tagged and
	    untagged mode.

	#157855 (Bug #29933) *
	    P4Python now correctly loads the value of P4CHARSET from the
	    environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2008.1

	#157600 *
	    Added support for P4.run_resolve(). The default for
	    run_resolve() is now to accept the merge hint provided by the
	    server unless the hint is "e", indicating a conflict. In this
	    case, run_resolve() will skip the resolve.

	    P4.run_resolve() can also accept a "resolver" keyword argument,
	    which should point to an instance of a subclass of P4.Resolver.
	    The subclass should overwrite the method
	    P4.Resolver.resolve(self, mergeData) and return a string
	    indicating how the resolve should proceed. 

	    To get the old behaviour of "resolve", run the
	    command P4.run("resolve"). You will need to set P4.input to the
	    correct response in this case.

	#152008 (Bug #28761) *
	    Added support for Python 2.4.

	#152362 (Bug #29024) *
	    The 'P4.env( var )' method has been added to the
	    P4 class. This instance method enables the caller to
	    interrogate the Perforce environment, including reading Perforce
	    variables from P4CONFIG files and, on Windows, the registry.
	    P4.cwd now loads any P4CONFIG file settings that are appropriate
	    to the new working directory.

	#153547 (Bug #29310) *
	    P4Python now supports Mac OSX 10.5.

Bugs fixed in 2008.1

	#175062 (Bug #31637) *
	    P4Python sometimes incorrectly decrements the reference count
	    of None when calling p4.run_filelog(). In certain
	    circumstances, this could cause Python to deallocate None,
	    causing a fatal error. This problem has been fixed.

	#168966 (Bug #31180) *
	    P4Python did not release its output variable correctly. This
	    caused a crash on 64 bit versions of Python when the P4 object
	    went out of scope. This is now fixed.

	#166644 (Bug #30723) *
	    P4Python connections were not being correctly cleaned up when
	    they were discarded due to a reference counting problem.
	    This problem has been corrected.

	#161025 (Bug #30076) *
	    Fixed a serious memory leak problem in P4Python. Basically,
	    all results returned from P4.run() had too many reference
	    counts, which prevented the Python garbage collector from
	    being able to clean up these objects. Now P4Python is memory
	    neutral, as can be checked with the debug version of Python,
	    which shows the total number of reference counts.

	#157844 (Bug #28653) *
	    Fixed an error with p4.run_filelog() when tagged output is
	    off. The "df" variable is now correctly initialized on
	    line 333 of P4.py. 

	#156847 (Bug #28770) *
	    Calling print to retrieve the contents of a file no longer
	    truncates content.

	#155969 (Bug #29703) *
	    When trying to create an illegal field in a Spec, P4Python
	    would try to raise a P4Error, only to fail because the wrong
	    number of arguments was provided to the Exception. This has
	    been fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs fixed in 2007.3

	#149927 (Bug #28703) *
	    The presence of deleted revisions in a file's history could
	    lead to P4Python throwing an error message. This occurred
	    because deleted revisions do not have 'digest' or 'fileSize'
	    fields. This problem has been corrected.

	#146116 (Bug #28260) * 
	    The P4Python test harness, p4test.py, was omitted from the
	    source distribution in error. This problem has been corrected.

	#146024 (Bug #28077) *
	    P4.Revision doesn't have a depot_file, or depotFile attribute
	    as its counterparts in P4Perl and P4Ruby do. This is now fixed.
